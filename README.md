SNHU CS-330 Computer Graphics

•	How do I approach designing software?

As with most problems I try to formulate a hypothesis and then try to disprove or prove. In CS this often takes the form of an algorithm or even Requirements.
    
•	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  
I previously had no experience with OpenGL. The closest I have ever come is to use other applications that build for OpenGL, e.g., using the Counter-Strike SDK to make scenes and game maps. Peering behind the curtain has been challenging but useful.

•	What design process did you follow for your project work?

I tried to accurately match the photographs I took of the scene, but I also needed to meet the Requirements as set out in the assignments. For example, the lighting in the room consisted of 7 LED lamps all with the same color, but the assignment required a colored lamp – I added the colored lamp even though there is not one in the real scene.

•	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I think the biggest take away from this course, and its approach, is to be iterative. Do not try to build the final project on day one. Instead, break that task down into small milestones, and then use those as stepping-stones. Some of the milestones may only ever be proof of concept also. Maybe a small stub or smaller implementation, e.g., light with only 2 components in the Phong lighting or textures without the camera callbacks, that can be used to test. These smaller implementations make debugging easier.

•	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My goal in the degree is to be a better project manager. I hope to achieve this by having a deeper, more intuitive understanding of what the other engineers are going through in their day to day. 

Computer graphics is one component of this understanding. Just the other day we were discussing building a lightweight visualizing tool, using GLUT, to investigate a new 3D sand control engine. I was able to converse at a much higher level than I would have been able without this course.
